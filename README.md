# 100WordsNetwork
A sort-of 'Chinese Room', a neural network taking in a few words and outputting a responce.

This is my Devtember 2017 project!

"I, Nils will participate to the next Devember. My Devember will be 100 words. I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise."
